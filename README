For my extended response, I decided to use a VBA script that is the heart of an Excel spreadsheet 
used by my co-workers at my current job. I have written more complex codes, but I am quite proud 
of this one, because it has eliminated a major source of stress and lost productivity for my team. 
Part of our job is to maintain the administrative details for thousands of accounts.  Unfortunately, 
the application designed by our IT department for this purpose emphasizes security over efficiency, 
and as a result, updates can only be made for one account at a time. Fortunately, our main server 
has a SQL interface, which allows bulk updates. My co-workers are not familiar with coding, and were 
afraid to use the interface. This VBA code allows my co-workers to submit the details they wish to 
update into the Excel spreadsheet, and at a push of a button, generates the corresponding SQL update 
query, error free. Tasks that used to take hours, now only take minutes. I am happy that I was able 
to make something that makes work less stressful for the people I see every weekday.
